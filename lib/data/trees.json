Flowers are greenish white, in erect panicles. Pods are thick, becoming more coiled as it develops, contains rose-red seeds which are covered in thick white pulp. The tree has many large branches that originate fairly low down on the trunk, resulting in a broad and relatively low crown. The terminal branchlets are thin and numerous, which gives the crown of the tree its characteristic dense but wispy appearance. Leaves are very pretty, with a pair of leaflets on either side of the leaf stalk, but their beauty is tempered by the sharp thorns that lie at their bases. The white flowers of the Madras Thorn are tiny and have numerous, conspicuous stamens. They are borne in heads of 10 to 20 flowers on stalks that reach 30cm or more in length. Fruits are coiled pods which ripen a tinge of rose-red, then split to expose thick white pulp surrounding shiny black seeds that seem to hang out on short, rose-red \"strings\". The pulp is edible.  The Madras Thorn was once a commonly planted roadside tree in Singapore. During the 1970s, this species suffered from major caterpillar attacks throughout Singapore.

        "description": "The tree can grow up to 30m in height with an umbrella shaped crown, very spreading (20-30m across). The bark is dark brown, rough and flaky in mature specimens. The leaves are twice pinnate compound. Small clusters of flowers are pinkish or whitish and slightly fragrant. The fruit pods are thick, long, straight and fleshy inside. The pods ripen black and do not split open.  The seeds readily germinate into seedlings and sometimes while still inside the fruit. Epiphytes like ferns and orchids tend to perch on old Rain Trees.  The leaves of the Rain Tree folded up in the evenings and that was why the Malays called it Pukul Lima, which means 5 o'clock. This was because 5pm used to be closer to the sunset hour in Singapore and Malaysia before changes to Standard Time were made on 1 Jan 1982. Notably, the leaflets began to close about one and a half hours before sunset to open about the same time after sunrise. The leaflets also close during the day when the sky was overcast, thus giving rise to the name, Rain Tree. This Central American species was dispersed throughout the tropics since the middle of the 1900s. It was introduced to Singapore in 1876 and spread throughout the region. Due to its excellent shade, the species was planted in the 1900s in coffee and nutmeg plantations and along roadsides. The sweetish fruit pulp were relished by cattle, goats, horses, pigs and even children in some countries. The girth of this Heritage Tree was 6.5m in 2001.",

The pods ripen black and the seeds germinate readily into seedlings, sometimes while still inside the fruit. Its sweet fruit pulp is relished by cattle, goats, horses, pigs and even children in some countries. Epiphytes like ferns and orchids tend to perch on old Rain Trees.    The Rain Tree originates from South and Central America. It was introduced to Singapore in 1876, and by the mid-1900s, it was planted throughout the tropics.    The leaves consist of leaflets which fold up in the evenings. This is why the Malays call it &lsquo;Pukul Lima&rsquo;, which means &lsquo;5 o&rsquo;clock&rsquo;.    <strong>The Connaught Drive Rain Trees over the years</strong>    Tree planting was formalised in 1881 by the then Superintendent of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Nathaniel Cantley. Roadside greenery is now a main feature of the business and commercial districts in Singapore.    1887 &ndash; Several Rain Tree saplings were planted along Connaught Drive, then known as New Esplanade Road. This road was renamed Connaught Drive in 1907 to commemorate the visit of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught.    1915 &ndash; The Rain Trees along Connaught Drive were well established, creating a scenic view of the waterfront for all to enjoy.    1930 &ndash; The lush greenery of the Rain Trees framed the forefront of the stately colonial buildings on the other side of the Padang.    1955 &ndash; The umbrella-shaped crowns of the Rain Trees along Connaught Drive created a &lsquo;green tunnel&rsquo; effect, enhancing the cityscape.    A total of 22 Rain Trees &nbsp;at Connaught Drive have been endorsed as Heritage Trees. This &ldquo;Avenue of Heritage Trees&rdquo; has the largest number of trees in a single avenue endorsed under the NParks&rsquo; Heritage Tree Scheme.    Some of these Heritage Rain Trees along Connaught Drive are estimated to have been planted in the mid-1880s, which would make them over 130 years old. They would have witnessed historic events in the Civic District including the declaration of independence for Singapore by the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1963, and Singapore&rsquo;s first National Day celebrations in 1966.    The Avenue of Heritage Trees underscores the rich history of the Civic District and how these majestic Rain Trees &nbsp;have matured over the course of time together with the growth of Singapore as a global city-st",

        "description": "Native to Singapore. Shorea gibbosa is a large emergent with greyish-brown bole and large and sharp buttresses. The bark is closely fissured when young, becoming scaly when older. It has white flowers with a tinge of pink, about 1 cm wide. The fruits are winged. The three outer wings (~ 1 cm) are slightly hairy. Shorea gibbosa produces dammar (resin) which is black. Locally, this is the only species of Shorea that belongs to the damar hitam (black) group of Shorea.  This Tree is probably one of the last few of this species standing in Singapore. These magnificent trees belonging to the Dipterocarp family can grow to a height of more than 30m. It produces commercially valuable timber and is popular with loggers because it is relatively free from defects and works well and cleanly with power and hand tools.  This Heritage Tree was seen flowering in August 2013. No fruit setting was observed later.",

Listed in the Singapore Red Data Book as: Critically endangered. The species only occurs in Northern Peninsular Malaysia and Southern Johore/Singapore. Most of the Southern Johore populations are gone or threatened by conversion (Symington). Based on the current surveys there could be around 50 trees. However, all trees are over/around 395cm girth. No seedlings or smaller trees have ever been found. So the population is not regenerating and might actually go extinct when these giant trees eventually die.

        "description": "A tall emergent tree that can reach a height of more than 50m in the forest. Pagoda shaped crown. Simple leaves arranged in whorls. Fluted trunk. Usually found in lowland forests and swamps. Native.  This is a native species that is critically endangered in the wild in Singapore. Specimens still can be found in the Central Catchment & Bukit Timah Nature Reserves. It is unique from other members of the Alstonia genus in that it has pneumatophores, or breathing roots, hence its scientific name. In swampy areas, these will poke out of the soil above the water surface to allow exchange of gases. This particular specimen at the Singapore Botanic Gardens does not exhibit growth of pneumatophores as the soil is well drained.  This Tree is believed to be in excess of 160 years of age, perhaps much older. It is believed that only 15 remaining wild specimens in Singapore exists and there is no record of it being planted in SBG, so it is presumed to be a remnant pre-1859, of native swamp forest that formerly existed in the Gardens. The specimen is exceptionally beautiful with a perfect clean bole and symmetrical canopy. One of the rarest native trees of Singapore that is easily seen by the public. This Tree is evidence of a now very reduced vegetation type.",

It is well known that its flowers open at night and are pollinated by bats.    In its native range, it flowers often, but fruits infrequently. Once it reaches around 30 or 40 years of age, the trunk begins to swell disproportionately to the size of its crown, often reaching 17 m in girth. This species is known to reach about 47 m in girth after 1,000 years, and the age of the largest Baobabs has been estimated at several thousand years.

Heartwood is heavy and reddish in colour. Leaves are simple, dark green, glossy, fine parallel veins. Flowers occur in clusters, white in colour, fragrant. Fruits are 2-5cm in diameter, ball-shaped, light green in colour, grow in clusters. Native, critically endangered in the wild. Cultivated.  This genus of trees, Calophyllum, is readily recognized by their beautiful leathery leaves: each leaf has numerous slender veins running parallel from the midrib to margin. In fact the word calophyllum comes from the Greek language which means ' beautiful leaf 'Â. The Penaga Laut is a tree of many uses: the oil from the seeds is used to heal a multitude of skin ailments and the resin, leaves and roots also have various medicinal uses. On 7 June 2012, two Dollarbirds (Eurystomus orientalis) were seen perching on the high branches of this Heritage Tree.",

Leaves once pinnate, spirally arranged, large, with a terminal leaflet and one to several opposite pairs of leaflets: stipules present. Fruits are drupes, oblong in shape. The shape is why they are linked to the western Olive (Olea europaea , Family: Oleaceae). Canarium actually belongs to the Family Burseraceae. Many trees of Burseraceae occur in the lowland forest of Malaya and also in the forest reserve on Bukit Timah in Singapore (E J H Corner, 4th Edition 1997).  Native to Southern China and East Asia, C. album was likely introduced and planted in Indo-Malesia for its edible olive-like fruits. The fruits are familiar locally, as the preserved Buah Ca-na snacks sold in corner shops. There is another species, the fruits of which are commonly eaten sweetened as snacks or salted and with porridge. This is the Chinese Black Olive (Canarium pimela; synonym C. nigrum; synonym C. tramdenum). On 29 May 2012, 16 yellow fruits of C. album (see photo), each about 3cm long and 2cm wide, were collected from under this Tree. The fruits containing the seeds were sown in an attempt to germinate them. After about 3 months, more than 10 seedlings germinated. The seedlings were carefully nurtured and it will be good if young saplings could eventually be planted in parks and gardens.

Flowers are creamy white, turning yellow with age, strongly fragrant especially in the late evenings. Fruits are tiny red berries. They take more than three months to mature. Native to Singapore.  It was recorded that in the past when they were numerous, the Malayan Flying Fox (Pteropus vampyrus) fed on the berries of the Tembusu in season. The skins and minute seeds were disgorged in red splashes. From these minute, ejected grains, the big trees slowly develop. Other than bats and birds, the berries were too bitter to be relished by other animals. The wood was extremely durable and resistant to termite attack, making it highly suitable for heavy construction, bridges and carving.  In fact the wood was so hard that the Malays in metaphor compare a hard heart to it. This Tembusu was recently reported to be more than 180 years old. It is featured on the back of our Portrait series, Singapore 5-dollar note. It has a unique lower lateral branch which makes it easily recognisable. Many visitors over the generations have taken pictures with this iconic Tembusu Heritage Tree. ",

The bark is grey to reddish brown, rough and scaly. The leaves are simple, pointed and with a coating of scales on the underside which gives the characteristic coppery appearance. The flowers are large, white, cream or yellow, produced in bunches on the woody branches (cauliflorous). The fruits are large, round capsules, green to yellow and covered with many spines. On ripening the fruit drops to the ground and splits open into four to five segments, exposing the fleshy, yellow to cream pulp (aril) covering the seed. The ripe fruit emits a strong characteristic aroma, and this no doubt attracts various animals, including man, who seeks the pulp.  Durian is widely cultivated in Southeast Asia for its unmistakable large spiny fruits that split open to expose its creamy white flesh. Durian is an acquired taste as the strong odour can be overpowering to some. It is easy to spot a Durian tree by its leaves which have a coppery underside, giving the underside of the tree's crown a coppery colour.

Older E. cyclocarpum trees develop small buttresses and produce large roots that run along the surface of the ground for 2-3 m. Sidewalks, roads, or foundations may be cracked or raised by E. cyclocarpum trees growing close by. The bipinnate compound leaves of E. cyclocarpum have 5 opposite leaflets. The small white flowers occur in compact, round heads. Seeds contained in distinctive, thickened, contorted, indehiscent pods that resemble an ear in form. (Hence the common name.). Adult trees produce about 2000 pods, each with 10-16 seeds.     Products Food: Immature pods are cooked as a vegetable, or the seeds are toasted and ground. Fodder: Large quantities of highly palatable and nutritious pods containing a sugary pulp are produced by the tree, and are consumed readily by livestock. The foliage is also palatable, though to a lesser extent than the pods. Fibre: The wood of E. cyclocarpum has been found excellent for producing quality paper. Timber: E. cyclocarpum heartwood is reddish-brown, coarse-textured and moderately durable. The wood is resistant to attack by dry-wood termites and Lyctus, and can be used in house construction as well as in interior elements, including panelling. The white sapwood is susceptible to insect attack. The wood may also be used for boat building, because of its durability in water. Tannin or dyestuff: Tannin from the pods and bark is used in soap making. Medicine: Bark extracts are used medicinally against colds and bronchitis. Services Shade or shelter: The wide-spreading canopy of E. cyclocarpum makes it an ideal shade tree for livestock in pasturelands and perennial crops such as coffee. Nitrogen fixing: E. cyclocarpum is a nitrogen-fixing species. Ornamental: A popular tree for roadsides and urban planting. Intercropping: The ability of E. cyclocarpum to fix nitrogen and to sprout vigorously when coppiced point to its possible role as a hedgerow species in alley-cropping systems. Pests and diseases E. cyclocarpum has no widespread or serious disease or pest problem. Parrots often prey on the green pods, and the gall-forming moth, Asphondylia enterolobii, may disrupt fruiting. This Heritage Tree had a girth of 5.2m when measured in Year 2001.",

In tropical Africa, this tree is known as Ordeal Tree or Red Water Tree. The bark has been used in Africa as an arrow poison. When pounded and soaked in water, the water turns red, thus the name Red Water Tree. The bark was also once used as an ordeal poison among the African tribes as it contains an alkaloid which acts on the heart. Ordeal poisoning was practised with the witch doctor dispensing the poison to the accused. Should the accused die after drinking a portion of the bark in water, he is declared guilty.

Young leaves if eaten raw can cause irritation in the mouth. The kernel of the seed is flattened, dried and fried into a crisp known as emping or emping belinjau, which are often flavoured to be salty, sweet or slightly spicy, as the crisp tastes bitter on its own.</p> <p>This tree was likely one of the original plantings in the Singapore Botanic Gardens&rsquo; Economic Garden during the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century, making it about 100 years old when it was endorsed as a Heritage Tree in 2017.",

        "description": " Brazilian Ironwood is a handsome tree which can grow to 20 m tall with a fluted-base and a rather flat-topped crown. The species originates from tropical America including Brazil and Bolivia and is popularly planted in Singapore for its ornamental characteristics. It was formerly known as Caesalpinia ferrea.    It is deciduous in nature and sheds its leaves for a part of the year. The leaf is bipinnately compound and feathery-looking. Each leaflet is oval to round and less than 1 cm across.    The trunk is light buff-yellow, smooth to touch and rather like soft leather. With age, the bark becomes grey or brownish and peels off in long, jagged and curled pieces, leaving spots of beige new bark. The multi-hued trunk resembles the colouration of a leopard&rsquo;s hide, giving rise to its other common name, Leopard Tree.    Flowers are yellow, small, fragrant and borne in bunches near the branch tips. The seed pods are thick, green when young and turn dark brown, woody, hard and flattened when mature.    The wood of this species is extremely dense and heavy. The species epithet &lsquo;ferrea&rsquo; means &lsquo;iron&rsquo; in Latin and refers to the hardness of the wood.&nbsp; Unlike most other types of wood which will float in water, dried seasoned wood of the Brazilian Ironwood tree is so dense that it will sink instead!    The wood is often used for making fingerboards for guitars. It looks and feels similar to rosewood (Dalbergia spp.), but is harder with a slightly lighter colour. It is also used for flooring and furniture.&nbsp;    This fine specimen at Esplanade Park had a girth of 2.6 m when it was endorsed as a Heritage Tree in 2",

Fruits are bright red, round (2-3cm across), rough, textured skin. Seed, single, covered in sweet juicy translucent flesh.  The Lychee tree is a native of Southern China and Southeastern Asia and has been widely cultivated for its prized fruits for more than two millennia. The Lychee is a long-lived tree related to the Nephelium lappaceum (Rambutan),  Dimocarpus longan (Longan) , Nephelium mutabile (Pulusan) and Nephelium malaiense (Mata Kuching) fruit trees, but it seldom fruits under local conditions. Mount Rosie was a private driveway in the 1800's, leading to grand bungalows, and named after Ms Rosie de Souza, wife of Mr Theodore H Sohst, a wealthy merchant who had lived there.

The mature tree is fairly easy to identify from the bark which is covered in small lenticles giving it a unique \"bubbly\" texture. L elliptica has a monopodal habit that is most evident in younger trees, and not as obvious for mature trees.      Flowering occurs along the branches and behind the leaves and may easily go unnoticed by the casual observer. The first indication of flowering is the appearance of the yellow fluffy flowers on the forest floor.
