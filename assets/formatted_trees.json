        "Description": "A medium sized tree that can grow up to 15m in height. Crown is bushy and spreading, dull green in colour. Leaves are tiny and sprout from thorny twigs. Flowers are greenish white, in erect panicles. Pods are thick, becoming more coiled as it develops, contains rose-red seeds which are covered in thick white pulp. The tree has many large branches that originate fairly low down on the trunk, resulting in a broad and relatively low crown. The terminal branchlets are thin and numerous, which gives the crown of the tree its characteristic dense but wispy appearance. Leaves are very pretty, with a pair of leaflets on either side of the leaf stalk, but their beauty is tempered by the sharp thorns that lie at their bases. The white flowers of the Madras Thorn are tiny and have numerous, conspicuous stamens. They are borne in heads of 10 to 20 flowers on stalks that reach 30cm or more in length. Fruits are coiled pods which ripen a tinge of rose-red, then split to expose thick white pulp surrounding shiny black seeds that seem to hang out on short, rose-red \"strings\". The pulp is edible.  The Madras Thorn was once a commonly planted roadside tree in Singapore. During the 1970s, this species suffered from major caterpillar attacks throughout Singapore. The species was phased out from housing estates and roadsides subsequently.\r\nMadras Thorn is relatively resistant to fire and resprouts rapidly by basal or aerial shoots. Birds like to feed on the pulp contained in the pods, and this is how the seeds are spread. A native of Tropical America, it was introduced to this region by the Portugese and the Spanish. The common name of the species indicates people do adopt plants as their own. This species has uses as a fodder plant, the wood can be used in rough construction or as firewood, its bark yields gums and tannins and the pulp can be eaten and made into a juice. Its name Pithecellobium cames from the Greek word 'pithekos', meaning an ape or a monkey and 'lobos', a pod or a lobe. In Latin, 'dulce' means sweet.",

The bark is dark brown, rough and flaky in mature specimens while its leaves are twice pinnate compound. Its small clusters of flowers are pinkish or whitish and slightly fragrant and its fruit pods are thick, long, straight and fleshy inside. The pods ripen black and do not split open. The seeds readily germinate into seedlings, sometimes while still inside the fruit. Epiphytes like ferns and orchids tend to perch on old Rain Trees. </p>\n<p>The leaflets of the Rain Tree fold up in the evenings; this was why the Malays called it Pukul Lima, which means 5 o'clock. This was because 5 pm used to be closer to the sunset hour in Singapore and Malaysia before changes to Standard Time were made on 1 Jan 1982. Notably, the leaflets began to close about one-and-a-half hours before sunset and open about the same time after sunrise. The leaflets also close during the day when the sky was overcast, thus giving rise to the name, Rain Tree.</p>\n<p>This Central American species has been dispersed throughout the tropics since the middle of the 1900s. It was introduced to Singapore in 1876 and spread throughout the region. Due to its excellent shade, the species was planted in the 1900s in coffee and nutmeg plantations, and along roadsides. The sweetish fruit pulp was relished by cattle, goats, horses, pigs and even children in some countries.</p>\n<p>This is one of the tallest Rain Tree in Singapore at 35 m and it was endorsed as a Heritage Tree in 2015.

The bark is closely fissured when young, becoming scaly when older. It has white flowers with a tinge of pink, about 1 cm wide. The fruits are winged. The three outer wings (~ 1 cm) are slightly hairy. Shorea gibbosa produces dammar (resin) which is black.\r\nLocally, this is the only species of Shorea that belongs to the damar hitam (black) group of Shorea.  This Tree is probably one of the last few of this species standing in Singapore. These magnificent trees belonging to the Dipterocarp family can grow to a height of more than 30m. It produces commercially valuable timber and is popular with loggers because it is relatively free from defects and works well and cleanly with power and hand tools. \r\nThis Heritage Tree was seen flowering in August 2013.

Specimens still can be found in the Central Catchment & Bukit Timah Nature Reserves. It is unique from other members of the Alstonia genus in that it has pneumatophores, or breathing roots, hence its scientific name. In swampy areas, these will poke out of the soil above the water surface to allow exchange of gases. This particular specimen at the Singapore Botanic Gardens does not exhibit growth of pneumatophores as the soil is well drained. \r\nThis Tree is believed to be in excess of 160 years of age, perhaps much older. It is believed that only 15 remaining wild specimens in Singapore exists and there is no record of it being planted in SBG, so it is presumed to be a remnant pre-1859, of native swamp forest that formerly existed in the Gardens. The specimen is exceptionally beautiful with a perfect clean bole and symmetrical canopy. One of the rarest native trees of Singapore that is easily seen by the public.

Leaves once pinnate, spirally arranged, large, with a terminal leaflet and one to several opposite pairs of leaflets: stipules present. Fruits are drupes, oblong in shape. The shape is why they are linked to the western Olive (Olea europaea , Family: Oleaceae). Canarium actually belongs to the Family Burseraceae. Many trees of Burseraceae occur in the lowland forest of Malaya and also in the forest reserve on Bukit Timah in Singapore (E J H Corner, 4th Edition 1997).  Native to Southern China and East Asia, C. album was likely introduced and planted in Indo-Malesia for its edible olive-like fruits. The fruits are familiar locally, as the preserved Buah Ca-na snacks sold in corner shops. There is another species, the fruits of which are commonly eaten sweetened as snacks or salted and with porridge. This is the Chinese Black Olive (Canarium pimela; synonym C. nigrum; synonym C. tramdenum). On 29 May 2012, 16 yellow fruits of C. album (see photo), each about 3cm long and 2cm wide, were collected from under this Tree. The fruits containing the seeds were sown in an attempt to germinate them. After about 3 months, more than 10 seedlings germinated.

The name Couroupita comes from the South American plant name; and 'guianensis' means from The Guianas.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 0cm;\">The Cannonball Tree is a most beautiful and remarkable tree that has fascinated botanists with its curious form. It looks like no other tree one is familiar with. </p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 0cm;\">The massive trunk is intertwined with a mass of thick long stalks bearing large showy flowers and large rounded fruits, with the latter looking very much like cannon balls. This is unusual as most trees bear their flowers and fruits on the branches, rather than along the trunk.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 0cm;\">Its flowers are bisexual, large, about 12 cm across, fleshy, waxy and fragrant. There are 6 sepals, 6 petals which are yellow on the outside and pink on the inside and many stamens. The tissue of the flower when broken is white but turns blue.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 0cm;\">Fruits develop in 18 months, remaining on the tree for a year or more before they fall with a thud. They are very large and round, up to 25 cm across, greyish brown, hard and looking like cannon balls. The fruits are filled with a smelly and soft red pulp. Old fruits disintegrate slowly to liberate the many seeds. The ripe flesh has an unpleasant smell. It was noted that the tree seems to be self-sterile as isolated trees would not fruit.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">It was grown for its interesting botanical features and also as an ornamental tree in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. It was used sparingly as a wayside tree in the past (along Napier Road / Tanglin Road, Connaught Drive and the Kent Ridge campus of the National University of Singapore). </p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 0cm;\">In Thailand, these trees can be found growing mostly in temple grounds. The Hindus in Singapore use the flowers for worship while in Sri lanka, they are used as offerings at Buddhist shrines and temples. In India, the flowers are offered to Lord Shiva by devotees. In its native country the shell of the fruit is made into utensils.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 0cm;\">This Cannonball Tree at the Singapore Botanic Gardens was planted in 1931 from seeds collected by Prof E J H Corner from tree specimen/s he found when he was in Colombo, Sri Lanka.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 0cm;\">This tree is dedicated to Tan Jiew Hoe.",

        "Description": "Native to Trinidad and the northern regions of South America, the Cannon Ball Tree is a beautiful tree with a fascinating and curious form. The name '<em>Couroupita</em>' comes from the South American common name for this plant (<em>kouroupitoumou</em>); and '<em>guianensis</em>' means from the Guianas, a region in north-central South America.</p>\n<p>The tree is cauliflorous in nature; the lower part of its massive trunk is lined with a mass of short woody branches bearing large showy flowers and large round fruits. The shape and size of the fruit look very much like cannon balls giving rise to its common name.</p>\n<p>The fragrant and brightly coloured flowers are bisexual, fleshy, waxy and large, measuring about 12 cm across. The flowers are yellow on the outside and pink on the inside with many stamens and the tissue of the flower turns from white to blue when broken. Fruits take about a year or more to develop and are large and greyish-brown at maturity. Ripe fruit usually falls from the tree, sometimes cracking to reveal the soft, red pulp inside which has a pungent odour. In the Amazon forests, the pulp is reportedly appetizing to animals like monkeys and pigs, which aid in seed dispersal.</p>\n<p>This Cannon Ball Tree on Tanglin Road was likely germinated from seeds collected in 1934 by Prof. E J H Corner. Prof. Corner collected these seeds from Cannon Ball Trees that he saw when he visited the famous Peradeniya Royal Botanical Gardens near Kandy, Sri Lanka. It was estimated that this Tree was more than 75 years of age when it was endorsed as a Heritage Tree in 2017.",

Corner wrote in the 3rd edition of his book, Wayside Trees of Malaya (1988), â€œIn parts of the East Coast States, the kapur formed almost pure forests, and it was at once distinguished by its beautiful, open, fine-leafed crown. It was one of the tallest trees in the Indo-Malayan tropics, frequently attaining more than 200 feet(60m) in height. Kapur-forests have been logged so extensively that they are hardly to be seenâ€. This species produces an aromatic resin which can be found all over the tree. To smell the resin, you can crush the fallen leaves at the tree base.

        "Description": "Durian trees can grow up to 40m in height, with a straight trunk and almost horizontal branches near the upper region of the trunk. The bark is grey to reddish brown, rough and scaly. The leaves are simple, pointed and with a coating of scales on the underside which gives the characteristic coppery appearance. The flowers are large, white, cream or yellow, produced in bunches on the woody branches (cauliflorous). The fruits are large, round capsules, green to yellow and covered with many spines. On ripening the fruit drops to the ground and splits open into four to five segments, exposing the fleshy, yellow to cream pulp (aril) covering the seed. The ripe fruit emits a strong characteristic aroma, and this no doubt attracts various animals, including man, who seeks the pulp.  Durian is widely cultivated in Southeast Asia for its unmistakable large spiny fruits that split open to expose its creamy white flesh. Durian is an acquired taste as the strong odour can be overpowering to some. It is easy to spot a Durian tree by its leaves which have a coppery underside, giving the underside of the tree's crown a coppery colour.\r\nThis large specimen was planted by a resident of Pulau Ubin about 70 years ago and is still producing fruits. This Heritage Tree had a girth of 4.65m when measured in Year 2007.",

        "Description": "Enterolobium cyclocarpum is native to: Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, Mexico, United States of America &amp; Venezuela. It is one of the largest trees in the dry forest formation, reaching up to 40 m in height and 3 m in diameter, with a huge, spreading crown. Older E. cyclocarpum trees develop small buttresses and produce large roots that run along the surface of the ground for 2-3 m. Sidewalks, roads, or foundations may be cracked or raised by E. cyclocarpum trees growing close by. The bipinnate compound leaves of E. cyclocarpum have 5 opposite leaflets. The small white flowers occur in compact, round heads. Seeds contained in distinctive, thickened, contorted, indehiscent pods that resemble an ear in form. (Hence the common name.). Adult trees produce about 2000 pods, each with 10-16 seeds.  \n \nProducts\nFood: Immature pods are cooked as a vegetable, or the seeds are toasted and ground. Fodder: Large quantities of highly palatable and nutritious pods containing a sugary pulp are produced by the tree, and are consumed readily by livestock. The foliage is also palatable, though to a lesser extent than the pods. Fibre: The wood of E. cyclocarpum has been found excellent for producing quality paper. Timber: E. cyclocarpum heartwood is reddish-brown, coarse-textured and moderately durable. The wood is resistant to attack by dry-wood termites and Lyctus, and can be used in house construction as well as in interior elements, including panelling. The white sapwood is susceptible to insect attack. The wood may also be used for boat building, because of its durability in water. Tannin or dyestuff: Tannin from the pods and bark is used in soap making. Medicine: Bark extracts are used medicinally against colds and bronchitis.\nServices\nShade or shelter: The wide-spreading canopy of E. cyclocarpum makes it an ideal shade tree for livestock in pasturelands and perennial crops such as coffee. Nitrogen fixing: E. cyclocarpum is a nitrogen-fixing species. Ornamental: A popular tree for roadsides and urban planting. Intercropping: The ability of E. cyclocarpum to fix nitrogen and to sprout vigorously when coppiced point to its possible role as a hedgerow species in alley-cropping systems.\nPests and diseases\nE. cyclocarpum has no widespread or serious disease or pest problem. Parrots often prey on the green pods, and the gall-forming moth, Asphondylia enterolobii, may disrupt fruiting. This Heritage Tree had a girth of 5.2m when measured in Year 2001.",

In tropical Africa, this tree is known as Ordeal Tree or Red Water Tree. The bark has been used in Africa as an arrow poison. When pounded and soaked in water, the water turns red, thus the name Red Water Tree. The bark was also once used as an ordeal poison among the African tribes as it contains an alkaloid which acts on the heart. Ordeal poisoning was practised with the witch doctor dispensing the poison to the accused. Should the accused die after drinking a portion of the bark in water, he is declared guilty.

        "Description": "The Broad-leafed Mahogany is a large tree that can grow up to 30 m with a dense crown. It bears compound leaves that are glossy and dark green with asymmetric leaflets that are crescent-shaped. Being semi-deciduous in nature, it can lose its leaves during pronounced dry spells but young new leaves quickly open before the old leaves are completely shed. The broad and buttressed trunk has uneven, fissured dark grey bark. Its flowers are lightly fragrant, pale yellow to greenish in colour and occur in large bunches. The fruit is a distinctive, brown, large and heavy woody pod held upright on its stalk, splitting into five segments to release numerous flat single-winged seeds when mature.</p>\n<p>The Broad-leafed Mahogany is a native of tropical Central and South America ranging from Mexico to Brazil; it was introduced to Malaya, which includes Singapore, in 1876 from Honduras. Its timber is valued highly for making furniture, panelling and musical instruments.</p>\n<p>As shown in the web picture taken in Year 2006, this Heritage Tree was at a higher elevation than the adjacent Bayswater Road.&nbsp;When the Seletar Aerospace Park was developed in 2008, the surrounding houses were demolished, Bayswater Road and Hay Market Road were expunged and the land profile was changed. However, this Tree and the two nearby large Broad-leafed Mahoganies (HT 2003-119 and HT 2017-286) in the vicinity of the new Seletar Aerospace Drive Bus-stop number 05, were painstakingly conserved.</p>\n<p>These large trees could have been planted in the 1930s, around the time of the development of the Royal Air Force&rsquo;s Seletar station, and so this tree was estimated to be around 70 years of age when it was endorsed as a Heritage Tree in 2003.",

The leaves, when crushed, smell of turpentine.</p>\n<p>The flowers are fragrant, held in dense bunches and are greenish yellow to pale cream or even reddish in colour. There are usually two flowering seasons each year. The fruit contains a single large and hard seed that is round to oblong in shape, up to 20 cm long and 10 cm wide. The fruit ripens from green to yellow or orange.</p>\n<p>The varieties of mangoes available in our markets today are astonishing.

        "Description": "The Asam or Tamarind Tree is a slow-growing and large tree that can reach 30 m tall. It has beautiful fine-textured leaves and a round-shaped crown. It is native to tropical Africa and India, and grows best in well-draining soil.</p>\n<p>Tamarindus is monotypic, meaning that there is only one species in this genus (i.e., <em>Tamarindus indica</em>). The name of the genus <em>Tamarindus</em> is derived from the Arabic phrase <em>at-tamr al-hindi</em> meaning &lsquo;date of India&rsquo;, which refers to its fruit. The specific epithet <em>indica</em> suggests its origins to be from India.</p>\n<p>The Asam Tree bears brown fruit pods containing several flat hard seeds enveloped by a juicy pulp. Red-breasted Parakeets (<em>Psittacula alexandri</em>) have been seen feeding on the fruit. The sweet-sour pulp is known as tamarind or asam. The species is widely cultivated for this pulp, which is used in Southeast Asian and Indian cuisine to impart tart flavours in curries and fish dishes. Tamarind is also an ingredient in another popular and famous food item, Worcestershire sauce. Sweet tamarind, which is produced by cultivated varieties of the tree from Thailand, can also be found in markets.</p>\n<p>This beautiful Tamarind tree on the grounds of the Istana had a girth of 3.5 m when it was endorsed as a Heritage Tree in 2018.",

        "Description": "style=\"margin-left: 0cm;\">This Heritage Tree at the Singapore Botanic Gardens dates from 1884.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 0cm;\">Part of the mint family: Lamiaceae</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 0cm;\">This species originated from India, Myanmar, north Thailand, north-west Laos and East Java. It was introduced to Singapore. It is a large deciduous tree, reaching up to 40m in height in suitable climates.</p>\n<p>The Teak is a tree of the more open, monsoon-forest where a resting season is forced upon it by the dry weather. At such times, the tree is bare of leaves and it flowers and fruits after the new leaves have opened in the ensuring wet season. It appears that a lack of a dry season upset the growth of the Teak by compelling it to vegetate (bear leaves only) almost continuously. Also, the profusion of other trees suited for the rainforests of this region would prevent the Teak from establishing itself in our rainforests.</p>\n<p>Teak trees are deciduous after the dry season in monsoon weather. Where there is no marked dry weather, the trees remain evergreen.</p>\n<p>Teak is known for its high quality timber &amp; used in traditional medicine to reduce swelling.</p>\n<p>Teak is a yellowish brown timber with good grain and texture. Teak, though easily worked, can cause severe blunting on edged tools because of the presence of silica in the wood. Teak is often an effective material for the construction of both indoor and outdoor furniture. Teak's high oil content, high tensile strength and tight grain makes it particularly suitable for outdoor furniture applications. Over time teak can mature to a silvery-grey finish, especially when exposed to sunlight. It is used in the manufacture of outdoor furniture, boat decks, and other articles where weather resistance is desired. It is also used for cutting boards, indoor flooring, counter-tops and as a veneer for indoor furnishings. Teak is used extensively in India to make doors and window frames, furniture, and columns and beams in old type houses. It is very resistant to termite attacks. Mature teak fetches a very good price. It is grown extensively by forest departments of different states in forest areas.",

        "Description": "The Ketapang is a tree commonly found along the coasts of tropical Asia, Northern Australia and Polynesia, including Singapore. It can also be found growing inland along roads or in old Malayan villages where it was planted for its spreading crown, providing much needed relief from the tropical sun.</p>\n<p>It can grow up to 35 m tall and has a characteristic pagoda shape, a result of the whorls of horizontal wide-spreading branches growing at regular intervals along the trunk.</p>\n<p>This deciduous tree sheds its leaves twice a year in South East Asia and its leaves turn a vivid red or, in some cases, yellow before they fall. Leaves are simple, large, oval and narrow to a heart-shaped base. The dried leaves contain tannins that are said to have antibacterial and antifungal effects and are favoured by aquarium enthusiasts to condition the water for tropical fish. The small flowers emit a foetid smell and are grouped along a short flowering stalk with separate male and female flowers.</p>\n<p>Fruits are fibrous and oval in shape, turning yellow to pinkish yellow with maturity. The fruit has a corky rind and tiny air-cavities that allow them to float on water to new shores where they might germinate. The pulp of the fruit is sweet and the kernel has a delicate flavour, tasting like almonds, giving rise to its common name, Sea Almond. The fruit are also eaten by fruit bats which help in the seed dispersal.</p>\n<p>The timber can be used for houses and boat building while various parts of the plant are used in folk medicine from relieving rheumatic joints to dysentery.</p>\n<p>This Tree was estimated to be greater than 50 years of age and had a girth of 3.6 m when it was endorsed as a Heritage Tree in 2017.&nbsp;",
